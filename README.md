How to properly launch our Flask wepp : download the folders "static/images", "data" and "templates" and the file "app.py" and put them all in the same folder.

Next, launch the file "app.py" and make sure that you have all the needed libraries.

Run the program, and click on the link that will appear on your console ("http://127.0.0.1:5000/").

You can try to predict the type of a page block based on the seven most important variables and by choosing one of our three best models (Decision Tree, Random Forest and ADA Boost which all have ~98% accuracy).

You can try with different data as much as you want by clicking "Clear" or "Reset".

You can also check the full dataset by clicking "View Dataset".

Last but not least, you can check a summary of the problem by clicking "Summary".
